But some craftsmen were able to figure out how to compile this language. He has create `pyinstaller`.

## Abaut as pyinstaller and it problem
`pyinstller` this is a library that allows you to collect your source files into executable.
It work in console or terminal. It all depends on the OS you are running on. You need to input command in order to work.
It is not good. You just might forget command or flags. You need to open Chrome or another browser to find the command or flag you want.

## The solution to this problem
My program was created in order to solve this problem. You no longer need to remember these commands or flags. Now there is a convenient interface for all this. Using the buttons and chekbox, you select everything you need and compile your script into an executable file.
